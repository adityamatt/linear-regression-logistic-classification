Linear Ridge Regression:

    The code is in commented form:
    
    To create and save all the lamda,f pair average MSE values, Uncomment the section 20-54 in main.py
    This takes around 45 minutes to create and save all the data
    (I have already created and saved the above data)
    
    To load and create the graph of lamda vs MSE for different fractions Uncomment the section 58-74 in main.py
    
    To plot fraction vs MSE error, uncomment the section 77-97 in main.py
    
    To plot the predicted vs Actual values uncomment the section 104-124 in main.py
    
Regularized Logistic Classification:
    
    Just run the command python main.py in terminal to reproduce the results
